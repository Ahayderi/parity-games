# Parity Games
This repository contains the thesis I produced during my Bachelor project

During this project, I studied the computational complexity of solving parity games.
The above thesis resumes the forefront of research in the domain and tries to explain it while assuming very little background knowledge in the field. It includes explanations about the latest quasipolynomial algorithms, and suggests a new open question and framework for solving it to lower-bound a certain class of algorithms solving parity games.
