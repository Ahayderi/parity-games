# parity-games
This repository contains the thesis I produced during my Bachelor project

During this project, I studied the computational complexity of solving parity games.
The above thesis resumes the forefront of research in the domain, including the latest quasipolynomial algorithms, and suggests a new open question and framework for solving it to lower-bound a certain class of algorithms solving parity games.
